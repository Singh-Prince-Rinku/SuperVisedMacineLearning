#Supervised Machine Learning.
As I was mentioned that Supervised Machine Learning is one the most commonly used and sucessful types of MachineLearning.
In this repo, i  will describe Supervised Machine Learning in more details and explain several popular supervised learning algorithms. 
Contents Of Algorithms
1.Classification And Regression
2. Generalization, Overfitting and Underfitting 
     Relation of MOdel Complexity to Dataset Size
3. SVM(Supervised Machine Learning) Algorithms
    Some Sample DataSets
    K-Nearest Neighbours
    Linear Models
    Naive Bayes Classifier


    Note : This repo is not complete, I will updated more Algorithms in this repo.
